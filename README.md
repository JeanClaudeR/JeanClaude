## Hello :wave:

I'm Jean-Claude, my role [@SCOR Global Life](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcrazafy/) involves a mix of Data Science Advocacy, Communication and Training working with a team mixing Data Scientists, Actuaries & Underwriting experts. 

I also have experience in Non-Life (re)insurance and Quantitative Finance. 

I am also member of "Club Algo" which is a working group within the French Institute of Actuaries, dedicated to Data Science and applications of ML/AI in insurance.
Had the opportunity to present (in French) some work on Covid-19 ([Covid Trends](https://www.actuview.com/webinar-presentation-of-the-public-application-covid-trends_9e803a498.html))


#### Current goals

* :fire: &nbsp; To continuously improve in Data Science, Modelling and Data Story telling.
* :point_right: &nbsp;Ultimately promote the Data Analytics field through coaching, training and building prototypes with best practices.
